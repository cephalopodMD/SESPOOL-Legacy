print "This is a calculator". print "what operation type do you want? (1=arithmetic 2=trigonometry 3=exponents)". ask for the operations. set operations to 1 if operations is "arithmetic". set operations to 2 if the operations is "trigonometry". set operations to 3 if the operations is "exponents". if the operations is greater than 3, print "Whoops!", print "operation type not listed", and exit the program.
if the operations is 1, print "what operation do you want? (1=add 2=subtract 3=multiply and 4=divide)". if the operations is 2, print "what operation do you want? (1=sine 2=cosine 3=tangent)". if the operations is 3, print "what operation do you want? (1=square 2=square root 3=cube 4=cube root 5=logarithm)". ask for the operation. if the operation is greater than 5, exit the program. if the operation is greater than 4 and the operations is 1, exit the program. if the operation is greater than 3 and the operations is 2, exit the program. multiply operations by 10. add operations to operation. say "the operation is operation:" and say the operation. ask for x. if operations is less than 15, ask for y. 
if the operation is 11, print x plus y. if the operation is 12, print x minus y. if the operation is 13, print x times y. if the operation is 14, if y is greater than 0, print x over y. if the operation is 21, print the sine of x. if the operation is 22, print the cosine of x. if the operation is 23, print the tangent of x. if the operation equals 31, print the square of x. if the operation equals 32, print the square root of x. if the operation is 33, print the cube of x. if the operation is 34, print the cube root of x. if the operation is 35, print the log of x.
